v0.0.3
	- added Adapted Pointcheval's scheme
	- implemented SHA512 from (https://polarssl.org)
	- BPU_*Malloc - now using TYPE **pointer and laso BPU_*Free
	- implemented ASN1 key serialization using libtasn1 (external dependency) (https://www.gnu.org/software/libtasn1/) for mecs basic, Pointcheval's scheme, both with H matrix
	- some error checks fixed
	- added zero to support

v0.0.2
	- module organization: crypto, math, code, prng
	- convention unified see doc

	- removed memory leaks
	- removed functions which are allocating memory inside for output (suffix A)
	- posibility to build with or w/o using H precomputed matrix by decription
	- added basic tests
	- removed Adapted CCA2 Pointcheval's scheme (TEMPORARLY)
	- no external dependecies

v0.0.1
